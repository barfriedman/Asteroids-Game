# Asteroids-Game

Was created as part of the course Introduction to CS by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Welcome to the Asteroid game! In order to win, you need to shoot torpedos at the asteroids, break them until there are no asteroids left. 
Move the ship with the ledt and right arrow keys and accelerate using the up arrow key. Shoot torpedos using the space key.

When running the game, enter the amount of asteroids you want to play with. The more asteroids there are - the harder the game is!
